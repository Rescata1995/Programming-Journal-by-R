**Topics that we will cover divided into weeks:**

_**Week 1.**_ 

1. Programming languages (What is a Programming language, about Syntax & Coding) and Some benefits of using any programming language to work with your data (A. Clarify the steps of your analysis, B. Saves time, and C. Reproduce and share your work)

2. Similarities and differences between Spreadsheets, SQL & R

3. Four reasons about why people who work with data love R; R is accessible, data-centric, open-source and has an active community of users & Three specific situations when you might use it for data analysis (A. Reproducing your analysis, B. Processing lots of data, and C. Creating data visualizations)

4. What type of software application is RStudio & What panes include RStudio

_**Week 2.**_ 

1. What is a Data structure & Lists. Lists are vectors that can keep different types of data 

2. date, time & date-time as Data types in R (Formatting and Converting different types of data into date and date-time using Tidyverse & Lubridate packages: from a String, from an individual date & from an existing datetime object) Extra. now() & today() functions

3. Other common data structure in R: Files, and Basic concepts of R (Function, Argument, Comment, Variable, Data types, Vector & Pipe)

EXTRA. Step by step Getting to know how to use packages, functions and datasets in R from start to finish via diamonds.rmd file. 

**Reminder of basic functions**: 

Step 1. Using R Packages: install.packages(), library(). 

Step 2. Viewing data: head(), str(), glimpse(), colnames().

Step 3. Cleaning data: rename(), summarize()

Step 4. Visualizing data: ggplot(aes()) + geom_point() + facet_wrap()

Don't forget the useful 'priority column' from the command 'install.packages()'. The priority column tells us what's needed to use functions from the package. If you come across the word "base" in the priority column, then the package is already installed and loaded. You can use all of the functions of that package as soon as you open RStudio. If you find the word "recommended," then the package is installed but not loaded.
